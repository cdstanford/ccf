# Support CCF

The CCF fund is open for donations! We receive donations through the [Philanthropic Ventures Foundation (PVF)](https://www.venturesfoundation.org/), a 501(c)(3) public registered non-profit. Donations through PVF are fully tax-deductible.

For smaller donations by credit card, you can donate [here](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/philanthropicventuresfoundation) and select "Computing Connections Fellowship." We also have a [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/eaddc022) that you can use. Please note that both platforms charge a 3% processing fee.

For larger donations or to avoid the processing fee, please [contact us](contact).
