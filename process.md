# Selection Process

## Eligibility

To be eligible, applicants should be PhD students in programming languages or a closely related area. Beyond these basic criteria, eligibility for the program is evaluated based on:
- **Environmental need:** The current environment (research, home, etc.) is unsafe or unhealthy for the student. Examples of situations that may foster unsafe or unhealthy environments include any form of abuse, bullying, harassment, discrimination, trauma, or loss, or any other circumstance that makes it difficult or impossible for the student to work effectively in their current environment. This list is non-exhaustive and the committee has the discretion to determine any situation to be unsafe or unhealthy.
- **Interest:** The student is interested in a temporary research visit at another institution, as part of the fellowship.
- **Financial need:** The student does not have access to an alternative source of funding (for example, funding from their own institution) for such a temporary research visit.

We expect these criteria to broaden to capture other research areas when we expand beyond the two-year pilot in the programming languages community.

## Review of Applications

Applications are assessed by the [selection committee](people) on a rolling basis, first-come first-served while funding is available. In case of more applications satisfying all of the above (environmental need, interest, and financial need) than can be funded, applications will be prioritized based on the extent of need.

## Support Offered

There are two different potential categories of funding depending on need: partial and full.

### Partial Funding

Partial funding is useful when the advisor supports the move and is willing to continue funding the student, but the student has an urgent need to escape. In this case, the funding should cover the costs of travel, and in some situations help cover the cost of living in a second place (as it is not always possible to break a lease or sublet while you're in another area). In the ideal scenario where ample funding exists, helping with incidental costs would also be beneficial.

### Full Funding

Full funding is useful when the advisor will cut off funding for the student if the student flees. Advisor abuse is the main use case here, though an unsupportive advisor coupled with outside sources of abuse can function similarly. In this case, the above costs may exist, but the student may also have no additional source of income. This can be prohibitive for some students, thereby forcing them to stay in dangerous situations for fear of losing income. The ideal is a full RAship or internship for a semester to a year.
