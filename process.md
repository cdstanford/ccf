# Selection Process

## Eligibility

To be eligible, applicants should be PhD students in programming languages or a closely related area. Applicants should also be 18 years or older. Beyond these basic criteria, eligibility for the program is evaluated based on:
- **Environmental need:** The current environment (research, home, etc.) is unsafe or unhealthy for the student. Examples of situations that may foster unsafe or unhealthy environments include any form of abuse, bullying, harassment, discrimination, trauma, or loss, or any other circumstance that makes it difficult or impossible for the student to work effectively in their current environment. This list is non-exhaustive and the committee has the discretion to determine any situation to be unsafe or unhealthy.
- **Interest:** The student is interested in a temporary research visit at another institution, as part of the fellowship.
- **Financial need:** The student does not have access to an alternative source of funding (for example, funding from their own institution) for such a temporary research visit.

We expect these criteria to broaden to capture other research areas when we expand beyond the two-year pilot in the programming languages community.

## Review of Applications

Applications are assessed by the [selection committee](people) on a rolling basis, first-come first-served while funding is available. In case of more applications satisfying all of the above (environmental need, interest, and financial need) than can be funded, applications will be prioritized based on the extent of need.

## Support Offered

There are two different potential categories of funding depending on need: partial and full. Partial funding supports needs like travel, housing, and other incidental costs; full funding additionally supports the student for an RAship. Eligibility for these categories depends on student circumstances and need, as well as funding availability.
