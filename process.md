# Selection Process

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible, applicants should be PhD students in programming languages or a closely related area. Beyond these basic criteria, eligibility for the program is evaluated based on:
- **Environmental need:** The current environment (research, home, etc.) is unsafe or unhealthy for the student. Examples of situations that may foster unsafe or unhealthy environments include any form of abuse, bullying, harassment, discrimination, trauma, or loss, or any other circumstance that makes it difficult or impossible for the student to work effectively in their current environment. This list is non-exhaustive and the committee has the discretion to determine any situation to be unsafe or unhealthy.
- **Interest:** The student is interested in a temporary research visit at another institution, as part of the fellowship.
- **Financial need:** The student does not have access to an alternative source of funding (for example, funding from their own institution) for such a temporary research visit.

Applications are assessed on a rolling basis, first-come first-served while funding is available. In case of more applications satisfying all of the above (environmental need, interest, and financial need) than can be funded, applications will be prioritized based on the extent of need.

We expect these criteria to broaden to capture other research areas when we expand beyond the two-year pilot in the programming languages community.

## Support Offered

There are two different potential categories of funding depending on need: partial and full. See the budget for more details on funding estimates for each of these.

### Partial Funding

Partial funding is useful when the advisor supports the move and is willing to continue funding the student, but the student has an urgent need to escape. In this case, the funding should cover the costs of travel, and in some situations help cover the cost of living in a second place (as it is not always possible to break a lease or sublet while you're in another area). In the ideal scenario where ample funding exists, helping with incidental costs would also be beneficial.

As an example, a student may wish to do an informal research visit to escape bullying, but may continue to be funded by a remote TAship at their host university. Such a student may need to pay for housing in both the city of their university and the city of the host university, which may cost an additional $700 for one month (on the low end). They may also need to pay for flights in both directions, which may cost about $300 (also on the low end). Finally, they may need to fill prescription medication ahead of time, which may not be covered by insurance; this may cost an additional $400. The total cost may be $1400 for one month, making financial security the gating function for whether or not the student can take this potentially life-saving opportunity.

The estimated need for this is **about $10000 per student-year**; needs may vary by host location and by individual student situation.

### Full Funding

Full funding is useful when the advisor will cut off funding for the student if the student flees. Advisor abuse is the main use case here, though an unsupportive advisor coupled with outside sources of abuse can function similarly. In this case, the above costs may exist, but the student may also have no additional source of income. This can be prohibitive for some students, thereby forcing them to stay in dangerous situations for fear of losing income. The ideal is a full RAship or internship for a semester to a year.

As an example, a student fleeing advisor abuse may wish to do a research visit at another university for a semester to secure a safe research environment and a letter of recommendation while working on an application to transfer universities. In such a situation, the advisor may retaliate and cut funding if the student flees. Such a student may need similar travel, housing, and incidental costs met, as well as the cost of an RAship at their university. Costs of RAships vary by university; students at Illinois cost about $30000 per year, while students at CMU cost closer to $85000 per year. The ability to secure this funding may help students escape abusive environments without putting undue pressure on faculty to choose between funding a student visitor and knowing the student may be stuck in an unsafe situation.

The estimated need for this is **about $50000 per student-year**; individual needs may vary, especially considering potential differences in student costs at different universities. In the case in which insufficient funding to fully support the student is available, even partial support towards this end with hosts contributing some small amount could still be life saving and significant.

## Selection Committee

We are in the process of recruiting a selection committee through a public nominations form, which has been publicized (1) through SIGPLAN CARES and SIGPLAN-M organizations, (2) in the SIGPLAN newsletter and TYPES mailing lists, and (3) on social media. The first group of people we plan to ask to join our selection committee is a group of trusted and reputable community members who are interested in the mission of the program, have diverse experiences and backgrounds, are trusted and reputable community members, and are sensitive and receptive to student needs and concerns:

1. Caleb Stanford (Junior Faculty, Chair of Selection Committee)
1. TBD (PhD Student)
1. TBD (Senior Faculty)
1. TBD (Industrial Researcher)

## Outreach

The fellowship will have a public website: https://computingconnections.org/, which will include:
- A way to apply for the fellowship
- A way to reach out confidentially with a request for help or specific support, or a suggestion for feedback
- List of members and volunteers of the organization
- A public copy of the text of this document, detailing the selection criteria

The website will *not* include the recipients of the fellowship or institutions where the fellowship has been awarded.

Outreach will also be carried out through communication with research organizations and confidential advocate groups, through relevant mailing lists, through individual university student advocacy organizations, and by word of mouth.

## Budget

For a pilot two year program, the total anticipated budget is about $140,000. This figure is based on 4 student-years of partial funding and 2 student-years of full funding. See the table below for a breakdown of this estimate:

| ----------------------- | -------- |
| **Partial Funding**     |          |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Total per student-year  |  $10,000 |
| Total (4 student-years) |  $40,000 |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| **Full Funding**        |          |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Total per student-year  |  $50,000 |
| Total (2 student-years) | $100,000 |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| **Total**               | $140,000 |
| ----------------------- | -------- |

Knowing how many students may need partial or full funding is a difficult question. The estimates above come from the experiences of the authors as trusted community members who have heard from a number of students with similar needs in the past few years, coupled with the intuition that the number of students we have heard from is likely to be an underestimate, as there may be many students who do not reach out for help. We will adapt based on historical trends after the pilot of the program. We also expect that this budget will grow after the initial two year pilot in accordance with the broadening of scope beyond the programming languages community to computer science more generally.
